👋 Hi there, I'm Saintzycode!
I'm a second-year student passionate about building cool things with code. Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I explore new technologies and bring ideas to life!

💻 My Toolkit
Here are the tools I use to create my projects:

VS Code: My go-to code editor for most of my development work.

Android Studio: The primary IDE for my mobile development projects.

Figma: I use this for designing user interfaces and creating prototypes before I start coding.

🌐 Languages & Frameworks
I'm currently working with the following languages and technologies:

Flutter/Dart: Building beautiful and natively compiled applications for mobile.

Python: Used for scripting, data analysis, and back-end development.

HTML, CSS & JavaScript: The foundational languages of the web.

React: Creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

🌱 What I'm Learning
I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and skills. This semester, I'm focusing on strengthening my skills in data structures and algorithms with Python and exploring state management in React to build more complex web applications.

🤝 Let's Connect!
I'm always open to collaborating on projects or discussing new ideas. Feel free to reach out to me here on GitHub or check out some of my repositories to see what I'm working on.

Thank you for visiting my profile!
